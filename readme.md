## The reconstruction of the assignment submission tool.
before this, there are one tool developed by python using related libs.
but there were some things I encountered that were a hassle. one of the things is GUI when using GUI to develop, the consequential file size will be bigger than 50MB, but there in fact only 9MB before using GUI.

### The Target of Develop Java Edition
1. newer than before! :D
2. more features!

Haha, Let's see what's new seriously!
1. no invasion configured yet, such as no edit userFile, no config.txt in user's folder.
## Features of The Newest Version
> that is to use mature technology to resolve current questions I need to be solved.
- Java edition should only get users' inputs and mechanical processes, with no data should be stored in the program.
- all of the data should be stored in the database ( now using MongoDB Atlas), For example, users' data, assignments data, files data, and the new feature is that save the user's computer data so that related account.
- new construction and new design of the tool, I will use the philosophy of software engineering to design my tool.
- the large file can be stored in the cloud DB.
- the retrieve message that the user queries all of the statuses of the files can be accomplished.

## Now design

## the description of an older version
maybe this project should be public on GitHub as a repository?
> developed and continuous update by python within 4 months range.
